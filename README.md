### **Introduction**
**Eternal Social** is a next-generation social media platform where **AI regulates user interactions**, and **blockchain ensures AI's accountability**. Unlike traditional moderation methods that rely on human intervention, Eternal Social leverages **decentralized AI moderation** to maintain transparency, fairness, and accuracy and accountability of the system. Which in turn reduces the need for manual intervention and would help social media platforms regulate themselves by autonomous systems.

### **Goals**
We prioritize **free speech** while promoting **responsible online behavior**. Users earn **points for empathetic interactions** and lose points for **toxicity, racism, or spreading misinformation**‚Äîbut neutral conversations remain unaffected, and no private data is collected.  

To counter disinformation, we use **deep learning models trained on custom datasets** for **deepfake detection**, and a **balanced news verification system** that cross-references **left-wing, right-wing, and Gemini AI web agent searches** before issuing a verdict. This ensures **truthful, unbiased information** reaches users.

## ü§î Why Should Social Media Integrate This‚ùì‚ùì  
### **Future of social media:**
The **future of social media moderation** will be entirely **AI-driven**, eliminating the need for human intervention in content monitoring. AI will autonomously handle:  
- **Reputation scoring** based on user behavior.  
- **Fake news detection** through AI-powered cross-referencing.  
- **Deepfake identification** using advanced deep learning models.  

### **Why ‚Çølockchain?? and why this type of system??:**
 AI must be **held accountable**‚Äîwhich is why **blockchain integration** is crucial. By recording moderation actions on an **immutable ledger**, Eternal Social ensures:  
- **Transparent AI decisions** that cannot be manipulated.  
- **Decentralized moderation**, eliminating bias and corporate influence.  
- **Reduced costs** for social media companies by replacing manual monitoring.  
- **A safer online space** where trust is built through verifiable actions.  


Eternal Social **redefines content moderation** by merging AI efficiency with blockchain security‚Äîcreating a **scalable, fair, and self-regulating social ecosystem**.

### üìå Core Features & Modules  

#### üèÜ **1) Reputation Updation**  
- Users are assigned **reputation scores** based on their online behavior.  
- Blockchain **immutably** stores reputation data to prevent tampering.  
- High-reputation users get **privileges**, while low-reputation users would face  restrictions and possibly a ban if it goes below a certain level.  

#### üö´üì∞ **2) Fake News Prevention using LeftWing/RightWing Sources and AI agents**  
- AI **analyzes content credibility** using cross-referenced sources.  
- Blockchain ensures **verified news sources** are immutable.  
- Misinformation is flagged, and users are alerted before sharing.
- AI bots **crawl & verify** trending news from trusted sources.  
- Users can see a **trust score** for each news article.    

#### üé≠ **3) Deep Fake Detection**  
- AI scans images/videos for **manipulated media** using advanced detection models.   
- Social platforms are alerted to **remove flagged content**.  

#### üí¨ **4) Empathy Mode**  
- Users can **enable Empathy Mode** to transform their messages into a more **positive and constructive tone**.  
- Whether it's **criticism, professional discussions, or personal conversations**, the goal is to **foster respectful communication** without restricting emotions.  
- Ensures that **everyone is treated with dignity**, promoting a **healthier online environment**.  
- **Completely optional**‚Äîusers can choose when to activate it for empathetic interactions.

# **How to Deploy Eternal-Social**  

## **Part 1: Smart Contract Deployment**  
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder:  
   ```sh
   cd Eternal-Social
   ```  
2. Install Truffle globally if not installed:  
   ```sh
   npm install -g truffle
   ```  
3. Initialize Truffle:  
   ```sh
   truffle init
   ```  
4. Compile the smart contracts:  
   ```sh
   truffle compile
   ```  
5. Start a Truffle development blockchain:  
   ```sh
   truffle develop
   ```  
6. Deploy the contracts:  
   ```sh
   migrate
   ```  
7. After migration, you will get a contract address. Copy this address.  
   ![Contract Address](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ecaa0a6-4e4d-4151-bbf0-013215cf47b6)  
8. Open `app3.py` and replace `deployed_contract_address` with the new contract address.  
   - Use **Ctrl+F** to find `deployed_contract_address`.

## **Part 2: Running the Backend**  
1. Open another terminal and install dependencies:  
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  
2. Ensure all required libraries are updated to the latest versions.  
3. Start the FastAPI server:  
   ```sh
   python -m uvicorn app3:app --reload
   ```  
4. Open your browser and go to:  
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:8000/
   ```  
   - Open **two tabs** of this URL.  
   ![Server Running](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f182830c-e6a7-4a73-a310-b1ac188f2ac0)  

5. Enter the **wallet address** obtained from `truffle develop`.  
   ![Wallet Address](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee31ff68-462a-4d5d-8424-14d7880924bf)  
6. Use two different wallet addresses for two clients/users and click **Connect**.  
7. Enjoy the decentralized experience! üöÄ
